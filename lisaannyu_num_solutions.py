""" In this exercise, you will specify an array by providing a
1-dimensional list of numbers and a tuple containing the shape of the array.

For example, the following

    >>> data = range(8)
    >>> shape = (2, 2, 2)

corresponds to the following ndarray

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> x = np.arange(8)
    >>> x.shape = (2, 2, 2)

Note that (as in part of homework 1) you will not be allowed to use NumPy
in your implementation.  Specifically, you should only use Python builtins,
`product`, and `reduce`.  I've already imported product and reduce.  You
should not add any additional imports.  The purpose of this assignment is
to have you implement everything by hand (with the exception of product
and reduce).

Your task is to implement some of the functionality of NumPy's arrays.  To do
this, you will be representing a multidimensional array as a (linear) 1-D list
of numbers.  You will store the multidimensional layout of the data array in a
shape tuple.  There are two standard ways to fill-in the multidimensional
structure specified by shape from the linear order of the list of
numbers---row-major and column-major order.

You will be using row-major ordering (NumPy's default) for this exercise.
So you will need to understand what that means.

Consider this example:

    >>> x
    array([[[0, 1],
            [2, 3]],

           [[4, 5],
            [6, 7]]])
    >>> x[0, 0, 0]
    0
    >>> x[0, 0, 1]
    1
    >>> x[0, 1, 0]
    2
    >>> x[0, 1, 1]
    3
    >>> x[1, 0, 0]
    4
    >>> x[1, 0, 1]
    5
    >>> x[1, 1, 0]
    6
    >>> x[1, 1, 1]
    7

Look carefully at the pattern.  Notice that the axis on the far right
position increments the fastest.  Then the axis next to it increments
a little slower.

Let's look at a bigger example.

    >>> x = np.arange(64)
   >>> x.shape = (2, 4, 4, 2)
    >>> x[0, 0, 0, 0]
    0
    >>> x[0, 0, 0, 1]
    1
    >>> x[0, 0, 1, 0]
    2
    >>> x[0, 0, 2, 0]
    4
    >>> x[0, 0, 3, 0]
    6
    >>> x[0, 1, 0, 0]
    8
    >>> x[0, 2, 0, 0]
    16
    >>> x[0, 3, 0, 0]
    24
    >>> x[1, 0, 0, 0]
    32

Notice that when you cycle on the ith axis each increase is in a fixed amount,
depending on the shape of the array and the position in the index that is
incrementing.

Below you will find several functions involving working on arrays
represented as a list of numbers and a tuple containing the shape of the
array.  As a result, the first two arguments to many of the functions will
normally correspond to this information.
